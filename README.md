Overview:
Structurizr is an open-source tool that supports the C4 model for visualizing software architecture. It is designed specifically for the "Architecture as Code" approach, allowing teams to define architecture diagrams using code. It integrates well with version control systems, enabling the architecture to evolve with the codebase.

Why Structurizr?

Scalability: Structurizr scales effectively to handle complex, enterprise-level architectures. It can manage multiple layers of abstraction (Context, Container, Component, and Code) in a single model.
Code-Based Diagrams: Diagrams are defined in code (e.g., DSLs like PlantUML or YAML), which ensures that they are versioned, maintainable, and can be reviewed like any other piece of code.
Integration: It integrates well with DevOps pipelines and CI/CD processes, allowing architecture updates to be part of the regular development workflow.
Collaboration: Structurizr supports team collaboration by enabling shared models and components, making it easier to reuse architectural elements across projects.

Why PlantUML?
Text-Based: PlantUML is text-based, making it easily interpretable by Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT. LLMs can generate, modify, and interpret the structure and content of these diagrams efficiently.
Human-Readable: The syntax of PlantUML is straightforward and human-readable, which aligns with the need for maintainability and clarity.
Extensibility: PlantUML supports various diagram types (sequence diagrams, class diagrams, etc.), allowing for comprehensive documentation of different aspects of the architecture.
Interoperability: PlantUML integrates well with Structurizr, providing a seamless transition between high-level architecture and detailed design diagrams.

# Prompt example:

I would like to generate architectural diagrams using the C4 model in PlantUML. Please use the following setup:

Model: C4 Model
Use Context, Container, Component, or Code levels as specified.

Diagramming Tool: PlantUML, VS Code
Diagrams should be written in PlantUML syntax, compatible with C4 model conventions, .puml files encloses with @startuml and @enduml

Repository: Shared Git repository
Assume the diagrams will be stored in a version-controlled Git repository, allowing for collaboration and tracking changes. The repository is structured as follows:

/diagrams: This directory contains the C4 model diagrams, organized into subdirectories by their respective levels (Context, Container, Component, Code). Each diagram has a corresponding .puml source file and a rendered output (e.g., .png).

/src: This directory holds reusable software components, organized by platform or module (e.g., /src/data_platform, /src/web_platform). Each component is defined in a separate .puml file, which can be included in higher-level diagrams.

/src/shared-components: Contains reusable elements like databases, microservices, or user representations that can be included in various diagrams for consistency.

/src/stdlib: Includes the PlantUML Standard Library, either as a cloned repository or a Git submodule, for using standardized components and icons in diagrams. Usage: 

```plantuml
@startuml
!include <C4/C4_Component>
!theme C4_superhero from <C4/themes>
@enduml
```

Output: Provide the PlantUML code that can be easily integrated into our repository. The code should be modular and reusable, facilitating updates as the architecture evolves. Ensure that the components are correctly linked from the /src directory where applicable.

Instructions: Ensure the diagram output is clear, follows C4 best practices, and includes necessary relationships and interactions between components.

When generating the diagram, consider the structure, reusability of components, and potential integration with CI/CD pipelines for automated updates.

Please generate the PlantUML code based on the following architectural details:

Example Repository: Finally, provide an example architecture repository for a data platform built using an Open Source and modern data stack. This repository should illustrate best practices and demonstrate the use of the chosen tools and formats.
